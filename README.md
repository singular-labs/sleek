## Overview
Check it out first! --> https://sleek-py.herokuapp.com

Sleek is a friendly framework to build your own generic scripts with minimal UI efforts!

## Notes
This is a developement proof-of-concept code which is not production ready.
It's extremely helpful when you want to expose functionalities in your Python based system to non-tech audiences (that won't run a script by themselves).
